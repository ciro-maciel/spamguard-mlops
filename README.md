# SpamGuard MLOps — Landing

This repository highlights two complementary tracks of my MLOps skill set:

- Concepts (baseline): principles, architecture decisions, and end-to-end flow.
  Branch: mlops-concepts

- Market tools: DVC (data versioning) + MLflow (experiment tracking/model registry),
  hardened CI/CD and containerized deployment.
  Branch: mlops-market-tools

How to use:

- Read this overview and pick the track you’re interested in.
- Each branch has its own README with Quickstart, decisions, and trade-offs.

What you’ll see:

- Train → metric-gated promotion → serving
- Versioned artifacts, schema migrations (Drizzle/SQLite)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD
- Docker/Compose and K8s manifests (portability)
- DVC and MLflow in the market-tools track
